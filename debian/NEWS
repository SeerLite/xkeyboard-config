xkeyboard-config (1.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The current defaults do not enable the traditional
    Ctrl-Alt-Backspace key combination to kill the X server. If you
    would like to re-enable this feature, you may do so in your
    desktop's Keyboard Preferences application. You may also enable it
    for the current session using the command 
	"setxkbmap -option terminate:ctrl_alt_bkspc".
